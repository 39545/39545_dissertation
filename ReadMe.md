## Abstract
Most current pandemic preparedness plans make mention of expert information as a crucial part of health risk communication in public health emergencies. However, there is a dearth of research on the effect of such communication efforts in low- and middle-income countries. This paper uses data from a randomised control information experiment on the matter in El-Salvador during the onset of the recent COVID-19 pandemic to investigate the role of expert information in shaping risk perceptions and policy support. The findings suggest that the effect of expert information is limited to specific framings and certain conditions. Prior beliefs about the communicated risk as well as personal experiences are strong moderators of the effect of expert information.
